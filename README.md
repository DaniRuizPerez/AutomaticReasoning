Automatic Reasoning Projects 
============

This is a collection of projets that I developed for the Knowledge Representation and Automatic Reasoning course in the junior year of my undergrad in computer science at UDC (Spain). The projects are the following:


- **Automated canon composer with multiple voices using Answer Set Programming** that takes into account many melodic restrictions and preferences. It uses the tools gringo, clasp, python and lilypond. A short example audio file is provided, created with one of the preference files provided. Using Python, clasp, gringo and lilypond.


- **Hitori Puzzle Solver** that transforms a simplified version of the Hitori puzzle into a set of CNF boolean clauses based on the rules of the game, calls a propositional satisfiability (SAT) solver and creates the solution. Using Python and picosat.


- **Probabilistic Reasoning with Answer Sets** that calculates the probabilities of different things happening on the Big Bang Theory game Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock. Using P-log.


- **Theorem prover** project that checks whether a conclusion follows from the premises using a theorem prover for Predicate Calculus called Prover9. This software accepts a list of formulas in First Order Logic and decides whether a formula is valid or not by refutation using resolution.
